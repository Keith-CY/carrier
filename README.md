# Carrier

Phase 1 scaffold for the Agent Installation Platform.

## Current scope
- Runtime: local host (macOS/Linux), WSL2 (Windows)
- Full lifecycle target: OpenClaw
- Candidate-only agents: Pi Mono, NanoClaw, Pico Claw
- Memory model: Per-Agent, Shared, Public
- Gateway providers: Telegram, Discord, Feishu

## Repository layout
- `daemon/`: Go daemon lifecycle, catalog, Base Agent triage interfaces
- `gateway/`: TypeScript gateway contracts and routing scaffold
- `catalog/`: OpenClaw manifest and candidate agent list
- `docs/`: Product and delivery documentation

## M2 daemon scaffold status
- Runtime prerequisite checks are implemented for local host and WSL2 requirement detection.
- Lifecycle service now executes install/start/stop commands through a runner abstraction.
- Start path validates required env vars and port conflicts before execution.
- Logs tail retrieval and diagnose zip artifact generation are available in the lifecycle service.

## M3 remote diagnosis scaffold status
- Lifecycle service now stores audit logs for lifecycle, triage, diagnose, and consent actions.
- Base Agent unresolved flow can create a remote diagnosis handoff placeholder with user consent.
- Handoff records include consent flag, status, and diagnose artifact reference.

## M4 gateway routing scaffold status
- Gateway now supports `pair/agents/install/start/stop/status/logs/upgrade/diagnose/diagnose-consent` routing scaffold.
- `/pair <code>` binds provider chat sessions and enforces session checks before non-pair commands.
- Gateway forwards `provider`, `chat_id`, and `request_id` into daemon request context for command handling.
- Logs/diagnose responses can issue short-lived read-only download tokens and URLs.

## Development flow
- Start work from `origin/main` using a new `codex/*` branch and worktree.
- Submit all feature updates via Pull Request.
- Use GitHub Actions as test source of truth.
- For non-blocking review suggestions, use `NBS:` lines (one suggestion per line). Post-merge automation creates follow-up issues from those lines.
